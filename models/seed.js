                More than 500 years old, and the second oldest city in the Americas, Old San Juan is a mix of Spanish colonial history layered with present day Puerto Rican life. The entire area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with hundreds of restored 16th- and 17th-century Spanish colonial buildings. Today, you can dine, shop, or even stay in some of these beautiful old structures.

                The main attraction is El Morro Fort (Fuerte San Felipe del Morro) jutting out on a peninsula high above the ocean, just a short walk from the city center. Constructed in 1539, El Morro's history, setting, and preservation make it one of the top tourist attractions in the country.

                In Old San Juan, some of the standout sites are the Fortaleza; the Castillo de San Cristóbal (San Cristóbal Fort); and the San Juan Cathedral, which holds the tomb of Ponce de León.`

It's a popular place to visit for a stroll or to row a rental boat around the pool and under the bridges.

You can rent a pedal car or ride though in a horse-drawn carriage. Busy any day, on Sundays the park overflows with families.

                The best way to see the giant trees, flower beds, pools, gazebos, and the man-made rock mountain with a waterfall is to stroll through the park, following the side paths into hedge-surrounded gardens.

The Nasrid dynasty's royal palace is the artistic highlight of Spain's Islamic period, when Al-Andalus – as they called Andalucía – represented the epitome of culture and civilization in Europe's Middle Ages.

                The Alhambra complex includes several buildings, towers, walls, gardens, and a mosque, but it's the indescribably intricate stone carvings, the delicate filigrees, the magnificent tile-lined ceilings, the graceful arches, and serene courtyards of the Nasrid palace that will haunt your dreams.

                That said, the adjoining palace built for the Emperor Charles V, even in its unfinished state is the finest example of High Renaissance architecture in Spain. And Generalife's terraced gardens offer a peaceful respite from the grandeur, and splendid views back at the rest of the Alhambra.`

                A wooden floor that was 83 by 48 meters covered two additional underground stories with tunnels, rooms, cells, and passages that provided space for gladiators, workers, wild animals, and storage.

Work began on the tower in the 1100s, and the sinking, which led to the lean, began by the time the tower reached the third story.

                Leaning more and more over the centuries, before restoration work in the 1990s, it was predicted to topple over by the year 2000. Today, visitors can climb up the stairs of the tower for a fabulous view over the city.

                The Leaning Tower stands on the Piazza dei Miracoli, a setting it shares with the beautiful Romanesque Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta and a round freestanding baptistery. Each of these features outstanding works of medieval stone carving.`
